## üê§ About Me 

Hi there! I'm a front-end developer who started coding at [Laboratoria](https://www.laboratoria.la/).

My professional approach is grounded in curiosity, creativity, empathy, and respect. These qualities are fundamental to me when facing challenges and working in teams.

My skills in digital tools, management, and participatory design are my calling card, always geared towards results.

Oh, by the way! I'm also a graduate in architecture and have an MBA.
